# Tank2017 Disclaimer
Tank2017: I don't claim Tank2017 is good for anything - if you think it is, great, but it's up to you to decide. If Tank2017 doesn't work: tough. If you lose a million because Tank2017 messes up, it's you that's out of the million, not me If you don't like this disclaimer: tough. I reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing. Do not distribute Tank2017 for profit! (seriously!). This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software packages, but mine is in plain English and theirs is in legalese. I didn't really want to include a disclaimer at all, but my lawyer insisted. I tried to ignore her but she threatened me with the shark attack at which point I relented.
